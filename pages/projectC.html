            <p class="change-font-size">
                As part of a collaborative group effort for the Final Course Project in Business Intelligence and
                Analytics, I collaborated with other students to solve real-world business problems using data-
                driven methods. Led the team in analyzing complicated statistics, building predictive models,
                and providing actionable visualizations to aid strategic decision-making in a simulated corporate
                environment.

                <li class="change-font-size">Presentation and Communication: Created and presented compelling presentations that
                    successfully communicated project results and suggestions. Ensured that complicated analytical
                    ideas were simply and concisely conveyed, promoting comprehension among team members
                    and stakeholders.</li>
                    <br>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="change-font-size">Outcome:</h2>
            <p class="change-font-size"> The Final Course Project in Business Intelligence and Analytics provides an excellent
                opportunity to work with peers and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world business issues.
                Our group successfully developed a comprehensive suite of business intelligence solutions

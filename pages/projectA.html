        <h1>Volunteer Activity Coordination System (VACS) | IS Project Management</h1>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            As part of a collaborative group project in the Information Systems (IS) Project Management
            course, I helped create and execute the Volunteer Activity Coordination System (VACS), which
            aims to improve volunteer management procedures for non-profit organizations. Played an
            important part in several elements of the project, including requirements gathering, system
            design, project management, and stakeholder communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Contributions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Actively engaged in stakeholder interviews and group
                discussions to collect and assess needs. Collaborated with teammates to obtain a thorough
                grasp of user needs and preferences.</li>
                <br>
            <li>System Design and Development: Worked directly with team members to help design and
                develop the VACS platform. Utilized coursework and self-directed study skills to offer unique
                ideas and solve technical issues.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Project Planning and Execution: Assisted with the development of project plans and
                timeframes, as well as job allocation and scheduling. Adopted Agile approaches to react to
                changing needs and keep the project moving forward.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Stakeholder Engagement: Communicated with project stakeholders, such as classmates and
                instructors, to gain input and ensure alignment with project objectives. Effectively engaged in
                group meetings and presentations to discuss progress and gather feedback.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Quality Assurance and Testing: Contributed to testing and quality assurance efforts by
                thoroughly testing system functionality. Collaborated with teammates to identify and fix problems
                and usability concerns.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Documentation and Presentation: Helped create project documentation, such as user
                manuals and technical specifications. Participated in group presentations to highlight project
                outcomes and discuss critical takeaways with colleagues.</li>
                <br>

        <h2>Outcome:</h2>
        <p>The Volunteer Activity Coordination System (VACS) project offered practical experience in
            project management and software development in a collaborative group environment. Our crew
            was successful in delivering a workable system prototype that proved the potential to expedite
            volunteer management operations for non-profit organizations thanks to good collaboration and
            communication.</p>

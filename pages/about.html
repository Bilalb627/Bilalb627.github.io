                <h1 class="change-font-size">About Me</h1>
                <p class="change-font-size">Hey there! I'm Bilal, a 22-year-old currently immersed in the vibrant world of business and technology at Toronto Metropolitan University. As I dive into my final year in university, set to graduate in Spring 2024, I find myself continually fascinated by the dynamic relationship between business strategies and technological innovations.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="change-font-size">I'm always looking to expand my knowledge of how technology molds and reshapes the business environment, whether I'm exploring the newest trends in smart home technologies or investigating the possibilities of AI-driven tech.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="change-font-size">Outside of university, you can frequently find me supporting my favourite Premier League and Champions League football clubs. My interest is always captured by the electrifying atmosphere of an action-packed match or the excitement of a last-minute goal. In addition, you could see me enjoying my passions for running and hiking out on the trails. For me, being out in the peacefulness of nature relaxes the mind.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="change-font-size">A bit of friendly competition, whether it be in the virtual or on-field arena, is something that I am always up for. I think that playing games with people can foster a great community. Video games offer an ideal balance of excitement and relaxation, from large-scale missions to competitive multiplayer battles.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="change-font-size">To put it simply, I'm a curious explorer, passionate about the connection of business, technology, sports, and the great outdoors. I look for forward to new experiences, meaningful connections, and possibilities that each day brings. So whether you want to discuss the latest technological advancements, analyze last night's match, or plan our next outdoor adventure, I'm always up for the journey. Let's connect and explore together!</p>

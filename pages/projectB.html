            <p class="change-font-size">
                As part of a collaborative group project for the worldwide Business Management course, I
                participated in the GLO-BUS Simulation, which simulates the experience of operating a virtual
                firm in a competitive worldwide market. Collaborated closely with coworkers to make strategic
                decisions across several company departments, acquiring practical expertise in business
                management and strategy creation.

        <h1>GLO-BUS Simulation | Global Business Management</h1>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            As part of a collaborative group project for the worldwide Business Management course, I
            participated in the GLO-BUS Simulation, which simulates the experience of operating a virtual
            firm in a competitive worldwide market. Collaborated closely with coworkers to make strategic
            decisions across several company departments, acquiring practical expertise in business
            management and strategy creation.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Team Strategy Development: Collaborated with team members to create and revise our
                company&#39;s strategy plan, considering market dynamics, competitive positioning, and resource
                restrictions. During team talks, I contributed ideas and insights that helped develop our overall
                approach.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Market Analysis and Research: Conducted market research to better understand customer
                preferences, market trends, and the competitive landscape. We used market data and industry
                studies to influence our product development and marketing plans, ensuring that they were in
                line with market demands.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Financial Planning and Analysis: Assist with budgeting, forecasting, and financial
                performance review. Collaborated with team members to examine financial statements and key
                performance indicators, finding opportunities for improvement and optimization.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Operations Management: Helped optimize operational procedures and resource allocation to
                increase efficiency and production. Worked together with team members to execute operational
                strategies that were consistent with our company&#39;s aims and objectives.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Effective Communication and Collaboration: Throughout the simulation, I kept open lines of
                contact with my teammates, giving updates, thoughts, and concerns. Actively engaged in team
                meetings and discussions to create a friendly and collaborative atmosphere.</li>
                <br>
        </ul>

            company management and strategy execution in a team context. Our team successfully

            marketplace via effective cooperation and strategic decision-making, exhibiting business
            acumen and teamwork competency.</p>

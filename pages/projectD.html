            <h2 class="change-font-size">Description:</h2>
            <p class="change-font-size">
                Worked together with a group of peers to accomplish the Final Course Project in Data and
                Information Management, which is an important component of our university curriculum. We
                worked together to address real-world data management difficulties, integrating classroom
                principles to create a comprehensive solution customized to the demands of a simulated
                commercial setting.

            <h2 class="change-font-size">Key Contributions:</h2>
            <ul class="change-font-size">

                <li class="change-font-size">Data Analysis and Requirements Gathering: Collaborated with team members to assess
                    data needs and set project objectives. Conducted research to identify important data sources
                    and potential problems, resulting in a comprehensive grasp of the project scope.</li>
                    <br>
                <li class="change-font-size">Database Design and Implementation: Helped to design and develop database schemas
                    using industry-standard tools and procedures. Collaborated with team members to standardize
                    data structures and improve database performance by using our collective experience.</li>
                    <br>
                <li class="change-font-size">Data Processing and Analysis: Helped design pipelines for cleaning, transforming, and
                    analyzing raw data. Used computer languages like Python and SQL to alter data and gain
                    meaningful insights.</li>
                    <br>
                <li class="change-font-size">Data Visualization: Helped develop data visualization tools and dashboards to effectively
                    communicate crucial results. Collaborated to pick relevant visualization approaches and create
                    intuitive interfaces for end users.</li>
                    <br>
                <li class="change-font-size">Documentation and Presentation: Contributed significantly to the preparation of project
                    documentation, which included design documents, data dictionaries, and presentation materials.
                    Participated in group presentations to highlight project accomplishments and exhibit our
                    knowledge of data management concepts.</li>
                    <br>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="change-font-size">Outcome:</h2>
            <p class="change-font-size"> The Final Course Project in Data and Information Management offered a great chance to apply
                classroom knowledge to real-world problems in a supportive team setting. Through efficient
                teamwork and shared experience, our team successfully created a comprehensive data
                management solution that demonstrated our talents in data analysis, database architecture, and
                data visualization, laying the groundwork for future attempts in the sector.</p>
